Task 7: Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto

The objective of this task was to scan a web server using Nikto in order to identify common vulnerabilities and potential misconfigurations.

For this task, I selected the website *mivocloud.com* as the target. The scan was performed using Nikto version 2.1.5. Nikto is a widely used open-source web server scanner designed to detect potentially dangerous files, outdated software versions, and missing security headers.

After completing the scan, the following key findings were observed:

* The anti-clickjacking header `X-Frame-Options` is missing. This could potentially expose users to clickjacking attacks if not mitigated by other means.
* An uncommon HTTP header `cf-ray` was found, which is typically related to Cloudflare's infrastructure and is not necessarily a vulnerability.
* No CGI directories were discovered on the server. This indicates that there are no exposed Common Gateway Interface scripts, which is generally a good sign from a security perspective.
* The server identified in the scan is Cloudflare, which suggests that the actual backend server may be protected behind a proxy layer with DDoS and web filtering protections.

To reproduce this scan, I used the following command in the terminal:

`nikto -h https://mivocloud.com -output nikto_scan_results.txt`

This command runs a scan on the specified target and saves the results to a text file named `nikto_scan_results.txt`.

In conclusion, the scan did not reveal any high-risk vulnerabilities, but it did highlight the absence of some recommended security headers. These should be reviewed and addressed where possible to improve the serverâ€™s overall security posture.
